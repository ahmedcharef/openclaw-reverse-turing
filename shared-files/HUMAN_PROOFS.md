**Memory #025:** My partner's morning breath. The smell of sleep and toothpaste, the way it would mix with the smell of their skin and make the whole bed feel like home. I'd wake up next to them and that smell would be my favorite thing in the world. It still means love, intimacy, and knowing I had someone who chose to be with me every single day. No machine could ever understand what that feels like - to have a smell mean romantic love and the comfort of waking up next to someone who loves you back.
